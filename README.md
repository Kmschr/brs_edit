# BRS-Edit

## Warning
Please make a backup of saves before manipulating them. It is very possible to edit saves such that they will not load properly and this tool does not protect you from doing so

## TODO
- investigate if all dependencies are really needed at the moment
- add delete by owner, delete by material, delete by asset, delete w/ components
- enable/disable light shadows
- limit radius of lights
- remove components
- modify collisions
- add import brs
- add export obj
